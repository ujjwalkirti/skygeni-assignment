Critical Deliverable – Reflection
Create a file:
THINKING.md
Answer:
What assumptions did you make?
What data issues did you find?
What tradeoffs did you choose?
What would break at 10× scale?
What did AI help with vs what you decided?


This document is as important as your code.
Submission
Share a GitHub repo with:
/backend
/frontend
/data
THINKING.md
README.md

Also, API endpoints should be same as specified above.
